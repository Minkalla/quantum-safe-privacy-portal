## 2. Security Assessment Results

### 2.1 Vulnerability Scanning with cargo-audit

**Scan Results:** ✅ **CLEAN** (1 non-critical warning)

```
Security Audit Summary:
- Total Crates Scanned: 46
- Critical Vulnerabilities: 0 ✅
- High Vulnerabilities: 0 ✅
- Medium Vulnerabilities: 0 ✅
- Low Vulnerabilities: 0 ✅
- Warnings: 1 (non-critical)
```

**Warning Details:**
```
Crate:     paste v1.0.15
Warning:   unmaintained
Title:     paste - no longer maintained
Date:      2024-10-07
ID:        RUSTSEC-2024-0436
Dependency tree: paste → pqcrypto-mldsa → qynauth_pqc
Risk Level: LOW (build-time only dependency)
```

**Risk Assessment:**
- The `paste` crate is used only at compile-time for macro generation
- No runtime security implications
- Functionality remains stable despite maintenance status
- Alternative: Monitor for maintained replacements

### 2.2 Policy Enforcement with cargo-deny
