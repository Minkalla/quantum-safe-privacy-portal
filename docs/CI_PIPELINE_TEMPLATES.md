# CI Pipeline Templates for WBS Implementation

**Purpose**: Reusable CI pipeline templates for different WBS categories  
**Base Template**: `testing-environment-validation-v1.yml` (WBS 1.2.4)

## Template: WBS 1.2.4 Testing Environment Validation

**File**: `.github/workflows/testing-environment-validation-v1.yml`  
**Use Case**: Database isolation, environment setup, testing infrastructure  
**Jobs**: 3 (Environment Setup → Integration Testing → Security Validation)

### Key Features
- MongoDB service integration
- Multi-language environment (Rust, Python, Node.js)
- Database connectivity validation
- Security scanning with Trivy
- PQC integration testing

### Customization Points
```yaml
# Modify for your WBS:
name: "WBS-X.X.X-validation-v1.yml"  # Update WBS number
env:
  WBS_SPECIFIC_VAR: "value"           # Add WBS-specific variables
services:
  # Add/modify services as needed
steps:
  # Customize validation steps for your WBS requirements
```

## Template: Future WBS Categories

### WBS 1.3.x (Core PQC Implementation)
**Focus**: Cryptographic correctness, FFI integration, algorithm implementation

**Required Additions**:
```yaml
- name: Cryptographic Test Vectors
  run: |
    # Test ML-KEM-768 and ML-DSA-65 implementations
    # Verify cryptographic correctness
    
- name: FFI Boundary Testing
  run: |
    # Test Rust/Python FFI integration
    # Memory safety validation
    
- name: Performance Baseline Validation
  run: |
    # Compare against performance baselines
    # Ensure no regression in crypto operations
```

### WBS 1.4.x (Integration & Deployment)
**Focus**: Production readiness, end-to-end workflows, deployment validation

**Required Additions**:
```yaml
- name: End-to-End Workflow Testing
  run: |
    # Test complete user workflows
    # Validate production deployment scenarios
    
- name: Load Testing
  run: |
    # Performance under load
    # Scalability validation
```

### WBS 1.5.x (Monitoring & Maintenance)
**Focus**: Operational excellence, monitoring, maintenance procedures

**Required Additions**:
```yaml
- name: Monitoring Validation
  run: |
    # Test monitoring and alerting
    # Validate operational procedures
    
- name: Backup/Recovery Testing
  run: |
    # Test backup and recovery procedures
    # Validate maintenance workflows
```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Copy Base Template
```bash
cp .github/workflows/testing-environment-validation-v1.yml \
   .github/workflows/WBS-X.X.X-validation-v1.yml
```

### 2. Customize for Your WBS
- Update pipeline name and WBS number
- Modify environment variables
- Add WBS-specific validation steps
- Update service dependencies

### 3. Request User Approval
Follow the approval process in `docs/CI_TESTING_STRATEGY.md`

### 4. Test Locally First
- Run validation steps locally when possible
- Verify integration with existing infrastructure
- Test security scanning and compliance
