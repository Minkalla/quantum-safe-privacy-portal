# CI Testing Strategy for WBS Implementation

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: June 26, 2025  
**Purpose**: Standardized CI testing approach for all WBS tasks

## Overview

This document establishes the mandatory CI testing framework for all Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) implementations in the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography project. Each WBS task must follow this standardized approach to ensure quality, security, and integration consistency.

## Mandatory CI Pipeline Pattern

### 1. **WBS-Specific Pipeline Naming Convention**
```yaml
name: WBS-{major}.{minor}.{patch}-validation-v{version}.yml
# Example: WBS-1.2.4-validation-v1.yml, WBS-1.2.5-validation-v1.yml
```

### 2. **Required Three-Job Structure**
Every WBS CI pipeline MUST include these three sequential jobs:

#### Job 1: Environment Setup Validation
- **Purpose**: Verify environment dependencies and configuration
- **Requirements**:
  - Multi-language environment setup (Rust, Python, Node.js)
  - Database connectivity validation (MongoDB)
  - Environment variable verification
  - Dependency installation and build verification

#### Job 2: Integration Test Validation  
- **Purpose**: Test integration with existing PQC infrastructure
- **Requirements**:
  - Backend build and integration tests
  - PQC component compatibility testing
  - Feature flag integration validation
  - Existing functionality regression testing

#### Job 3: Security Environment Validation
- **Purpose**: Ensure secure implementation and compliance
- **Requirements**:
  - Trivy security scanning
  - Vulnerability assessment
  - Database security configuration validation
  - Compliance requirement verification

## WBS-Specific Testing Requirements

### WBS 1.2.x (Environment & Pipeline)
- **Focus**: Infrastructure and testing environment validation
- **Key Tests**: Database isolation, environment separation, script security
- **Template**: `testing-environment-validation-v1.yml`

### WBS 1.3.x (Core PQC Implementation)
- **Focus**: Cryptographic correctness and FFI integration
- **Key Tests**: Algorithm implementation, memory safety, performance baselines
- **Required**: Cryptographic test vectors, FFI boundary testing

### WBS 1.4.x (Integration & Deployment)
- **Focus**: Production readiness and system integration
- **Key Tests**: End-to-end workflows, deployment validation, monitoring

### WBS 1.5.x (Monitoring & Maintenance)
- **Focus**: Operational excellence and maintenance procedures
- **Key Tests**: Performance monitoring, alerting, backup/recovery

## Mandatory User Approval Process

### Before PR Submission
1. **Engineer creates WBS-specific CI pipeline** following this strategy
2. **Engineer MUST request user approval** for the CI pipeline before PR submission
3. **User reviews and approves** the CI testing approach
4. **Only after approval**: Engineer submits PR with approved CI pipeline

### Approval Request Format
```
**CI Pipeline Approval Request for WBS X.X.X**

Pipeline Name: WBS-X.X.X-validation-vX.yml
WBS Objective: [Brief description]

**Three-Job Structure:**
1. Environment Setup: [Specific validations]
2. Integration Testing: [Integration points tested]  
3. Security Validation: [Security measures verified]

**WBS-Specific Requirements:**
- [List specific testing requirements for this WBS]
- [Integration points with existing infrastructure]
- [Security and compliance validations]

**Expected Pass Criteria:**
- [Specific conditions for CI success]
- [Performance thresholds]
- [Security requirements]

Ready for your approval to proceed with PR submission.
```

## Quality Gates and Pass Criteria

### Universal Requirements (All WBS)
- âœ… All existing tests must pass (no regressions)
- âœ… Security scans show no critical vulnerabilities  
- âœ… Build succeeds across all environments
- âœ… Integration tests pass with existing PQC infrastructure
- âœ… Zero technical debt (no TODO/FIXME/HACK comments)
- âœ… Code coverage >95%
- âœ… Documentation coverage 100%

### Performance Requirements with Automated Rollback
- âœ… Performance baselines maintained or improved
- âœ… Memory usage within acceptable limits (<50MB increase)
- âœ… Response times meet SLA requirements (<30% latency increase)
- âœ… Error rate <5% (triggers automated rollback if exceeded)
- âœ… CPU utilization <30% increase
- ðŸ”„ **Automated Rollback Triggers**:
  - Error rate >5%: Immediate rollback
  - Latency increase >30%: Gradual rollback with traffic shifting
  - Memory usage >50MB: Automated scaling and rollback
  - Critical vulnerabilities: Immediate deployment block

### Security Requirements with Deployment Blocking
- âœ… Trivy scan passes with no critical issues
- âœ… Grype vulnerability scan passes
- âœ… NPM audit shows no critical vulnerabilities
- âœ… OWASP ZAP security testing passes
- âœ… Database security configurations validated
- âœ… Input validation and sanitization verified
- âœ… Compliance requirements met (NIST, GDPR, ISO)
- ðŸš« **Deployment Blocking Conditions**:
  - Any CRITICAL security vulnerabilities
  - HIGH vulnerabilities >10
  - Hardcoded secrets detected
  - SQL/Command injection patterns found

### Code Quality Requirements
- âœ… No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- âœ… No SQL injection patterns
- âœ… No command injection vulnerabilities
- âœ… Proper error handling implemented
- âœ… Logging and monitoring integrated
- âœ… Performance monitoring enabled

## CI Pipeline Templates

### Template Location
- **Base Template**: `.github/workflows/testing-environment-validation-v1.yml`
- **Usage**: Copy and modify for each new WBS implementation
- **Customization**: Adapt the three jobs for WBS-specific requirements

### Template Structure
```yaml
name: WBS-X.X.X Validation
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  environment-setup-validation:
    # Environment and dependency validation
    
  integration-test-validation:
    # Integration with existing PQC infrastructure
    
  security-environment-validation:
    # Security scanning and compliance validation
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### CI Performance Tracking
- **Pipeline Duration**: Target < 15 minutes per WBS validation
- **Success Rate**: Target > 95% first-time pass rate
- **Security Scan Results**: Zero critical vulnerabilities

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain or improve existing coverage
- **Integration Points**: All PQC services tested
- **Documentation**: CI pipeline documented in PR description

## Troubleshooting Guidelines

### Common CI Failures
1. **Environment Setup Issues**: Check dependency versions and installation
2. **Integration Test Failures**: Verify PQC service compatibility
3. **Security Scan Failures**: Address vulnerabilities before proceeding
4. **Performance Degradation**: Investigate and optimize before merge

### Escalation Process
1. **First Attempt**: Debug and fix issues locally
2. **Second Attempt**: Investigate CI environment differences
3. **Third Attempt**: Request user assistance with detailed error analysis

## Compliance and Audit

### Documentation Requirements
- Each CI pipeline must be documented in PR description
- Security scan results must be included in PR
- Performance impact must be assessed and reported

### Audit Trail
- All CI pipeline changes tracked in git history
- User approvals documented in PR comments
- Security scan results archived for compliance
