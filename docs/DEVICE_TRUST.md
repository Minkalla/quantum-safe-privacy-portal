Device Trust Management Documentation (WBS 1.15)

## Overview

This document provides implementation guidance for trusted device workflows in the Quantum Safe Privacy Portal. Device trust enables enhanced security by establishing and maintaining trust relationships with user devices, reducing authentication friction for known devices while maintaining security for unknown devices.

## Implementation Status

✅ **COMPLETED**: WBS 1.15 Device Trust Management implementation
- Backend device trust logic with DeviceService
- Frontend device verification UI integration
- Auth middleware device trust validation
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Security enhancements and logging

## Architectural Decisions

### User Schema Location
**Decision**: All device trust changes—schema, audit timestamps, validation transforms—are implemented in `src/portal/portal-backend/src/models/User.ts`.

**Rationale**: This centralizes user-related schema modifications in the canonical User model location, avoiding confusion with legacy or stubbed paths. Future engineers should reference this location for all user schema extensions.

**Impact**: The `trustedDevices` array is added directly to the User schema in the models directory, ensuring consistency with the existing architecture.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components

#### 1. DeviceService Implementation
**Location**: `src/portal/portal-backend/src/auth/device.service.ts`

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class DeviceService {
  generateDeviceFingerprint(deviceInfo: DeviceInfo): string;
  generateDeviceId(): string;
  registerTrustedDevice(userId: string, deviceInfo: DeviceInfo): Promise<TrustedDevice>;
  validateDeviceTrust(userId: string, deviceFingerprint: string): Promise<{ trusted: boolean; decision: DeviceDecision }>;
  detectSpoofingAttempt(deviceInfo: DeviceInfo, userId: string): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

**Key Features**:
- SHA-256 based device fingerprinting using userAgent and IP address
- UUID-based device ID generation
- Spoofing detection with pattern analysis
- Structured logging with sanitized fingerprint data
- 30-day device trust expiration

2. Device Fingerprinting

Browser characteristics (User-Agent, screen resolution, timezone)

Hardware fingerprinting (available fonts, canvas fingerprint)

Network characteristics (IP address patterns)

Post-quantum cryptographic device certificates

#### 2. User Schema Extension
**Location**: `src/portal/portal-backend/src/models/User.ts`

```typescript
interface IUser {
  // ... existing fields
  trustedDevices?: {
    deviceId: string;
    fingerprint: string;
    deviceName?: string;
    deviceType?: 'desktop' | 'mobile' | 'tablet';
    lastUsed: Date;
    createdAt: Date;
  }[];
}

// Mongoose Schema
trustedDevices: [{
  deviceId: { type: String, required: true },
  fingerprint: { type: String, required: true },
  deviceName: { type: String },
  deviceType: { 
    type: String, 
    enum: ['desktop', 'mobile', 'tablet'] 
  },
  lastUsed: { type: Date, required: true },
  createdAt: { type: Date, required: true },
}]
```

</details>

#### 3. Auth Middleware Integration
**Location**: `src/portal/portal-backend/src/auth/auth.middleware.ts`

```typescript
interface AuthenticatedRequest extends Request {
  user?: {
    userId: string;
    email: string;
  };
  deviceFingerprint?: string;
  deviceTrusted?: boolean;
}
```

**Security Features**:
- Device trust validation for protected routes
- Sensitive operation blocking for untrusted devices
- X-Device-Fingerprint header extraction
- Path-based trust requirement configuration

#### 4. API Endpoints
**Location**: `src/portal/portal-backend/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`

- `POST /portal/auth/device/register` - Register trusted device
- `POST /portal/auth/device/verify` - Verify device with code
- `POST /portal/auth/device/check-trust` - Check device trust status

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Login Integration
**Location**: `src/portal/portal-frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx`

**Features**:
- Device fingerprint generation using browser characteristics
- 3-step authentication flow (Credentials → MFA → Device Verification)
- Device verification dialog with 6-digit code input
- X-Device-Fingerprint header integration

2. Trusted Device Management

// src/pages/TrustedDevices.tsx
interface TrustedDevicesPageProps {
  devices: TrustedDevice[];
  onRevokeDevice: (deviceId: string) => void;
  onRenameDevice: (deviceId: string, newName: string) => void;
}

3. Device Trust Indicators

Visual indicators for trusted vs untrusted devices

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Validation Middleware
- **Post-JWT Device Validation**: After token validation, middleware integrates DeviceTrustValidator
- **Trust Criteria Enforcement**: Blocks access if trust criteria aren't met for sensitive operations
- **Path-Based Protection**: Configurable paths requiring device trust validation

### 2. Spoofing Resilience
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies suspicious userAgent reuse patterns
- **Temporal Analysis**: Checks for recent device usage within 60-minute windows
- **Negative Test Cases**: Comprehensive testing for spoofing attempts

### 3. Header Hygiene
- **Fingerprint Sanitization**: X-Device-Fingerprint data sanitized in logs (first 8 chars + "...")
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper header allowlist including X-Device-Fingerprint
- **Log Redaction**: Sensitive headers stripped from default logs

### 4. Audit Logging
- **Structured Logging**: Device decisions logged with `deviceDecision` field
- **Decision Values**: `trusted | pending | blocked` with timestamps and reasons
- **Security Monitoring**: Consistent format for future telemetry integration

## Security Considerations

### Device Fingerprinting Security
- SHA-256 hashing of userAgent and IP address combinations
- Anti-spoofing detection through pattern analysis
- 30-day automatic device trust expiration
- Sanitized logging to prevent fingerprint data leakage
