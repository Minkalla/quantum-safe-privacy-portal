# Device Trust Management Documentation (WBS 1.15)

## Overview

This document provides implementation guidance for trusted device workflows in the Quantum Safe Privacy Portal. Device trust enables enhanced security by establishing and maintaining trust relationships with user devices, reducing authentication friction for known devices while maintaining security for unknown devices.

## Architecture Overview

### Device Trust Flow

    User->>Portal: Login with credentials

    Backend->>Backend: Validate credentials
    Backend->>Device: Check device fingerprint
    Device-->>Backend: Device characteristics
    Backend->>DB: Query trusted devices

        Backend->>Crypto: Generate device token
        Crypto-->>Backend: Signed device token

    else Device is unknown
        Backend-->>Portal: Require device registration
        Portal->>User: Prompt for device trust
        User->>Portal: Approve device trust
        Portal->>Backend: Register device request
        Backend->>Crypto: Generate device certificate
        Crypto-->>Backend: Device certificate
        Backend->>DB: Store device trust record
        Backend-->>Portal: Device registered
    end
```

## Implementation Requirements

### Backend Components

#### 1. Device Trust Service
```typescript
// src/auth/device-trust.service.ts
interface DeviceTrustService {
  generateDeviceFingerprint(request: Request): Promise<string>;
  registerTrustedDevice(userId: string, deviceInfo: DeviceInfo): Promise<TrustedDevice>;
  validateDeviceTrust(userId: string, deviceFingerprint: string): Promise<boolean>;
  revokeTrustedDevice(userId: string, deviceId: string): Promise<void>;
  listTrustedDevices(userId: string): Promise<TrustedDevice[]>;
}
```

#### 2. Device Fingerprinting
- Browser characteristics (User-Agent, screen resolution, timezone)
- Hardware fingerprinting (available fonts, canvas fingerprint)
- Network characteristics (IP address patterns)
- Post-quantum cryptographic device certificates

#### 3. Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE trusted_devices (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  device_fingerprint VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  device_name VARCHAR(100),
  device_type ENUM('desktop', 'mobile', 'tablet'),
  browser_info JSONB,
  last_seen TIMESTAMP,
  trust_level ENUM('basic', 'enhanced', 'full'),
  pqc_certificate TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);
```

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Device Registration Flow
```typescript
// src/components/auth/DeviceRegistration.tsx
interface DeviceRegistrationProps {
  onDeviceRegistered: (device: TrustedDevice) => void;
  onSkip: () => void;
}
```

#### 2. Trusted Device Management
```typescript
// src/pages/TrustedDevices.tsx
interface TrustedDevicesPageProps {
  devices: TrustedDevice[];
  onRevokeDevice: (deviceId: string) => void;
  onRenameDevice: (deviceId: string, newName: string) => void;
}
```

#### 3. Device Trust Indicators
- Visual indicators for trusted vs untrusted devices
- Device trust status in user profile
- Security notifications for new device logins

## Security Considerations

### Device Fingerprinting Security
- Use multiple fingerprinting techniques for robustness
- Implement anti-spoofing measures
- Regular fingerprint validation and updates
- Privacy-preserving fingerprinting methods

### Post-Quantum Cryptography Integration
- Device certificates using PQC algorithms
- Secure device key exchange protocols
- Quantum-resistant device authentication
- Migration strategy for classical to PQC certificates

### Trust Level Management
- **Basic Trust**: Standard device recognition
- **Enhanced Trust**: Biometric validation required
- **Full Trust**: Hardware security module integration

POST /portal/auth/devices/register
{
  "deviceName": "John's MacBook Pro",
  "deviceType": "desktop",
  "trustLevel": "basic"
}

// List trusted devices
GET /portal/auth/devices

// Revoke device trust
DELETE /portal/auth/devices/{deviceId}

// Update device information
PUT /portal/auth/devices/{deviceId}
{
  "deviceName": "Updated Device Name",
  "trustLevel": "enhanced"
}
```
