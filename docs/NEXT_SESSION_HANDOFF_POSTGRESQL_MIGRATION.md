      - name: Basic Security Scan
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
        with:
          languages: typescript, python
        continue-on-error: true # Don't block on medium/low vulnerabilities yet

  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Make sure it builds and starts
      - name: Build Application
        run: |

## ⚡ **Development Velocity Protection**

### **Smart Quality Gates**
```yaml
# Use conditional strictness
quality_gates:
  development:
    code_coverage: 60% # Lower bar for development
    performance: 1000ms # Relaxed for development
    security: CRITICAL only # Only block on critical issues
  
  staging:
    code_coverage: 75% # Higher for staging
    performance: 500ms # Better performance required
    security: HIGH+ # Block on high and critical
  
  production:
    code_coverage: 85% # Full coverage for production
    performance: 200ms # Enterprise performance
    security: MEDIUM+ # Zero tolerance
```

### **Fail-Fast Strategy**
```yaml
# Order pipeline for fast feedback
pipeline_order:
  1: Lint & Format (30 seconds) # Catch obvious issues first
  2: Unit Tests (2-3 minutes) # Fast feedback on logic
  3: Build & Smoke Test (3-5 minutes) # Ensure it works
  4: Security Scan (5-10 minutes) # Critical security only
  5: Integration Tests (10-15 minutes) # Deeper validation
  6: Performance Tests (15-20 minutes) # Expensive tests last
```

## 🚀 **Progressive Quality Evolution**

**Phase 1**: Ship fast, catch crashes
**Phase 2**: Add security and basic performance
**Phase 3**: Full enterprise standards
**Phase 4**: Acquisition-ready comprehensive pipeline

**Key insight**: You don't need enterprise CI/CD to build enterprise software - you need enterprise CI/CD to **validate** enterprise software.

**Start simple, evolve progressively, never let CI/CD block your development velocity during the critical building phase.**
