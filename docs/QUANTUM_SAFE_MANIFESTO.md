## The Quantum Threat Reality

### The Inevitable Quantum Revolution
The quantum computing revolution is not a question of "if" but "when." Within the next 10-15 years, sufficiently powerful quantum computers will render current cryptographic systems obsolete, threatening the foundation of digital security that protects:

- **$2.1 trillion** in global digital assets and transactions
- **Billions** of personal communications and private data
- **Critical infrastructure** including power grids, financial systems, and healthcare networks
- **National security** communications and classified information
- **The entire internet** as we know it today

### The Cryptographic Apocalypse
Current RSA, ECC, and DH cryptographic systems that secure today's digital world will be broken by quantum computers using Shor's algorithm. This represents the most significant security threat in human history:

- **Every HTTPS connection** will be vulnerable
- **All encrypted communications** will be readable
- **Digital signatures** will be forgeable
- **Blockchain and cryptocurrency** systems will be compromised
- **Privacy and security** as we know them will cease to exist

### The Window of Opportunity
We have a narrow window to act. The transition to quantum-safe cryptography must begin now, before quantum computers become powerful enough to break current systems. This is not just a technical challenge—it's a race against time to preserve digital civilization.
