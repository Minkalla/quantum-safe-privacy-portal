Effort Estimate: 8 hours Status: ☐ NOT STARTED Compliance: GDPR Article 15, NIST SP 800-53 AC-2, OWASP Top 10. Gap Analysis: Risk: Data exposure via unsecured DSAR APIs. Mitigation: RBAC middleware and HTTPS enforcement. Risk: Scalability issues with DSAR storage. Mitigation: Optimize MongoDB schema with indexing.

Sub-task 1.21.2: Develop Frontend DSAR Interface Objective: Build a DSAR submission and status view in the frontend. Activities: 1.21.2.1: Update src/portal/portal-frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (Task 1.19) with a “Data Rights” section using Material-UI Card and Form. 1.21.2.2: Create DSAR submission form (e.g., request type: access, deletion) and status table in src/components/DsarForm.tsx. 1.21.2.3: Ensure WCAG 2.1 accessibility with ARIA labels and high-contrast styling. Effort Estimate: 7 hours Status: ☐ NOT STARTED Compliance: GDPR Article 20, ISO/IEC 27701 7.4.3. Gap Analysis: Risk: Poor usability of DSAR interface. Mitigation: Intuitive Material-UI components and clear UX. Risk: Accessibility non-compliance. Mitigation: WCAG 2.1 compliance with ARIA attributes.

Sub-task 1.21.3: Integrate DSAR APIs with Frontend Objective: Connect the DSAR interface to backend APIs. Activities: 1.21.3.1: Use Axios (Task 1.6) in DsarForm.tsx to call POST /portal/dsar/submit and GET /portal/dsar/status. 1.21.3.2: Handle API responses (e.g., 201 Created, 401 Unauthorized) with user-friendly messages. 1.21.3.3: Apply white-label branding (Task 1.16) to DSAR UI dynamically. Effort Estimate: 6 hours Status: ☐ NOT STARTED Compliance: NIST SP 800-53 SC-8, OWASP Top 10. Gap Analysis: Risk: Insecure API communication exposing user data. Mitigation: HTTPS via Axios and secure JWT handling. Risk: Branding inconsistencies in DSAR UI. Mitigation: Dynamic branding from Task 1.16.

Sub-task 1.21.4: Test and Document DSAR Flow Objective: Test the DSAR flow and document its implementation. Activities: 1.21.4.1: Write unit tests for dsar.service.ts and DsarForm.tsx using Jest and React Testing Library. 1.21.4.2: Write integration tests for /portal/dsar/* endpoints using Supertest and msw for frontend API calls. 1.21.4.3: Document DSAR flow in docs/DSAR.md, including APIs, UI components, and test setup. Effort Estimate: 4 hours Status: ☐ NOT STARTED Compliance: NIST SP 800-53 RA-5, ISO/IEC 27701 7.4.3. Gap Analysis: Risk: Insufficient test coverage for DSAR flow. Mitigation: Comprehensive unit and integration tests. Risk: Unclear documentation impacting compliance. Mitigation: Detailed DSAR.md.

Effort Summary Total Estimated Effort: 25 hours Completed Effort: 0 hours Remaining Effort: 25 hours

Compliance Summary Maps to GDPR, NIST, OWASP, and ISO/IEC 27701 standards, ensuring secure and compliant data rights management. Continuous gap analysis mitigates risks across security, usability, and compliance.

Scalability and Innovation GDPR Compliance: Supports user data rights for regulated industries. Modularity: Prepares for advanced data rights features (Initiative 2). Cost Efficiency: Leverages existing backend (Task 1.5) and frontend (Task 1.6) infrastructure.
