Effort Estimate: 6 hours Status: ☐ NOT STARTED Compliance: GDPR Article 32, ISO/IEC 27701 7.2.8. Gap Analysis: Risk: Poor usability of integration placeholders. Mitigation: Intuitive Material-UI components. Risk: Accessibility non-compliance. Mitigation: WCAG 2.1 compliance with ARIA attributes.

Sub-task 1.20.3: Integrate Placeholder APIs with Frontend Objective: Connect frontend entry points to backend placeholder APIs. Activities: 1.20.3.1: Use Axios (Task 1.6) in Dashboard.tsx to call GET /portal/integrations/list and display mock data in IntegrationPlaceholder.tsx. 1.20.3.2: Handle API responses (e.g., 200 OK, 401 Unauthorized) with user-friendly error messages. 1.20.3.3: Apply white-label branding (Task 1.16) to integration UI dynamically. Effort Estimate: 5 hours Status: ☐ NOT STARTED Compliance: NIST SP 800-53 SC-8, OWASP Top 10. Gap Analysis: Risk: Insecure API communication. Mitigation: HTTPS via Axios and secure JWT handling. Risk: Branding inconsistencies in integration UI. Mitigation: Dynamic branding from Task 1.16.

Sub-task 1.20.4: Test and Document Integrations Objective: Test placeholder integrations and document their implementation. Activities: 1.20.4.1: Write unit tests for integration.service.ts and IntegrationPlaceholder.tsx using Jest and React Testing Library. 1.20.4.2: Write integration tests for /portal/integrations/* endpoints using Supertest and msw for frontend API calls. 1.20.4.3: Document integrations in docs/INTEGRATIONS.md, including APIs, UI components, and test setup. Effort Estimate: 3 hours Status: ☐ NOT STARTED Compliance: NIST SP 800-53 RA-5, ISO/IEC 27701 7.2.8. Gap Analysis: Risk: Insufficient test coverage for integrations. Mitigation: Comprehensive unit and integration tests. Risk: Unclear documentation delaying future integrations. Mitigation: Detailed INTEGRATIONS.md.

Effort Summary Total Estimated Effort: 20 hours Completed Effort: 0 hours Remaining Effort: 20 hours

Compliance Summary Maps to ISO 27001, OWASP, NIST, and GDPR standards, ensuring secure and modular integration placeholders. Continuous gap analysis mitigates risks across security, scalability, and compliance.
