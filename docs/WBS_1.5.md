🧪 Requires PQC integration verification: No  
🔐 Auth/API Contract Touched: Yes  
📁 Affects File Structure: Yes  
📌 CI Impacting: Yes  
---
Rationale:

PQC testing was introduced in Phase 4.1, not during backend refactor in WBS 1.5

However, /portal/auth and /portal/consent were implemented here, so devs must inherit those contracts

CI/CD flow was hardened: Dockerfile fixes, secrets bypass, ZAP/Trivy pipelines

File structure set patterns for src/portal/portal-backend and must be preserved going forward
