## 7. Local Development Parity & Runtime Validation (WBS 1.7)

### Endpoint Exposure & Compliance
- **GDPR Article 15**: Transparent access to `/api-docs` enables users and auditors to inspect available API routes.
- **OWASP API Security Top 10**: Local runtime validation of auth and consent endpoints (`/portal/auth/login`, `/portal/auth/register`) confirms proper authentication workflows in sandboxed development.

### Documentation & Developer Hardening
- `docs/ENDPOINT_TESTING.md`: Captures curl-based API validation and frontend-to-backend integration output.
- `docs/FRONTEND_DOCKER.md`: Provides onboarding clarity for Docker Compose usage and hot-reloading behavior.

### CI/CD Impact
- Validates consistent service orchestration (frontend, backend, MongoDB) in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Aligns developer machine behavior with cloud deployment expectations (NIST SP 800-53 CM-3).

### Security Continuity
- Leverages existing backend Dockerfile hardening from WBS 1.5, including cleanup of debug traces (`|| sleep infinity`).
- Hot-reloading container avoids caching issues that can undermine consistent frontend test results.
