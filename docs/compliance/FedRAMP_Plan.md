# FedRAMP Compliance Plan for Post-Quantum Cryptography

## Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program

### Overview
This document outlines the FedRAMP compliance plan for the Quantum-Safe Privacy Portal's Post-Quantum Cryptography implementation.

### Security Controls Implementation

#### Cryptographic Protection (SC-13)
- **NIST-Approved Algorithms**: CRYSTALS-Kyber-768 and CRYSTALS-Dilithium-3
- **Quantum-Safe Standards**: Compliance with NIST FIPS 203/204
- **Key Management**: Secure generation, storage, and lifecycle management

#### System and Information Integrity (SI-7)
- Cryptographic integrity verification
- Automated security testing
- Continuous monitoring and alerting

#### Configuration Management (CM-6)
- Standardized PQC algorithm configurations
- Version control and change management
- Automated deployment and validation

### Risk Management Framework

#### Categorization
- **Security Category**: Moderate Impact Level
- **Quantum Threat Assessment**: High priority for cryptographic modernization
- **Data Classification**: Sensitive authentication and privacy data

#### Security Control Assessment
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- Performance monitoring and baseline validation

#### Authorization
- Continuous monitoring approach
- Regular security assessments
- Documentation and evidence collection

### Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Algorithm implementation and testing (Current)
- **Phase 2**: Security assessment and documentation
- **Phase 3**: Authorization package preparation
- **Phase 4**: Continuous monitoring implementation

### Compliance Status
