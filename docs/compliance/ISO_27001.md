# ISO 27001 Compliance for PQC Integration

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 Information Security Management System (ISMS) compliance requirements for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) integration in the Quantum-Safe Privacy Portal.

## Applicable Controls

### A.12.3: Information Backup

**Control Objective**: To protect against loss of data.

**PQC Implementation**:
- **Quantum-Safe Backup Encryption**: Use CRYSTALS-Kyber-768 for encrypting backup data
- **Backup Integrity**: Use CRYSTALS-Dilithium-3 signatures for backup verification
- **Key Management**: Secure backup of PQC keys with proper lifecycle management

### A.12.4: Logging and Monitoring

**Control Objective**: To record events and generate evidence.

**PQC Implementation**:
- **PQC Operation Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all PQC operations
- **Audit Trail Integrity**: PQC signatures for tamper-evident audit logs
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of PQC performance metrics

### A.14.1: Security Requirements Analysis and Specification

**Control Objective**: To ensure that information security is designed and implemented within the development lifecycle.

**PQC Implementation**:
- **Quantum Threat Analysis**: Assessment of quantum computing threats
- **PQC Requirements**: Specification of quantum-safe cryptographic requirements
- **Security Architecture**: Design of PQC-enabled security architecture

## Implementation Status

- âœ… PQC monitoring and logging framework established
- âœ… Security requirements documented for quantum-safe implementation
- ðŸ”„ Full PQC backup encryption (WBS 3.x - Future phase)
- ðŸ”„ Complete audit trail integrity with PQC signatures (WBS 6.x - Future phase)
