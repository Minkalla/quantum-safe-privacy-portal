- **Security Level**: 192-bit (Category 3) compliance validation

#### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for PQC library functions
- Integration tests for authentication flows
- End-to-end tests for complete PQC workflows
- Performance benchmarking against baseline metrics

#### Compliance Status
- ✅ Security test framework implemented
- ✅ Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Performance monitoring established
- ✅ Vulnerability scanning integrated

### Implementation Details
The PQC implementation follows NIST standardized algorithms and includes comprehensive testing to ensure security and performance requirements are met.
