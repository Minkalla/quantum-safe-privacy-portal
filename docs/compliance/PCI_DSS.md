# PCI DSS Compliance for PQC Integration

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance considerations for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) integration in the Quantum-Safe Privacy Portal.

## Applicable Requirements

### Requirement 4: Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks

**PQC Implementation**:
- **Quantum-Safe Transmission**: Use CRYSTALS-Kyber-768 for key encapsulation
- **Future-Proof Encryption**: Protect against quantum computing threats
- **Hybrid Mode**: Support both classical and PQC encryption during transition

### Requirement 6: Develop and maintain secure systems and applications

**PQC Implementation**:
- **Secure Development**: PQC-aware secure coding practices
- **Vulnerability Management**: Regular assessment of PQC implementation security
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of PQC cryptographic functions

## Implementation Status

- âœ… PQC transmission security architecture designed
- âœ… Secure development practices for PQC implementation
- ðŸ”„ Full PQC encryption for payment data (WBS 2.x-3.x - Future phases)
