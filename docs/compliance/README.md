## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed (WBS 1.2.3)
- Comprehensive compliance documentation structure
- Security control mapping for PQC integration
- Regulatory requirements analysis
- CI/CD pipeline compliance validation

### ðŸ”„ In Progress (Future WBS Phases)
- **WBS 2.x**: Core PQC algorithm implementation
- **WBS 3.x**: System integration and hybrid mode deployment
- **WBS 5.x**: Security validation and compliance testing
- **WBS 6.x**: Performance optimization and monitoring

## Compliance Validation

Each regulatory standard includes:
- **Control Implementation Status**: Current and planned implementation
- **Testing Requirements**: Validation and assessment procedures
- **Documentation Requirements**: Evidence and reporting needs
- **Timeline**: Phased implementation approach

## Cross-Regulatory Alignment

The PQC integration strategy ensures alignment across all regulatory standards through:
- **Unified Security Architecture**: Common PQC implementation across all compliance requirements
- **Consistent Monitoring**: Integrated monitoring and reporting for all standards
- **Harmonized Controls**: Security controls that satisfy multiple regulatory requirements
- **Coordinated Timeline**: Phased implementation that addresses all standards simultaneously

## Contact and Updates

This compliance documentation is maintained as part of the Quantum-Safe Privacy Portal development process and is updated with each WBS phase completion.
