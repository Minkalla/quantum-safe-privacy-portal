# Web3 and Decentralized Identity Standards Compliance

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the Web3 and Decentralized Identity (DID) standards compliance for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) integration in the Quantum-Safe Privacy Portal.

## Applicable Standards

### W3C DID Core Specification

**PQC Implementation**:
- **Quantum-Safe DIDs**: Use PQC algorithms for DID document signatures
- **Key Management**: PQC key rotation and recovery for DIDs
- **Interoperability**: Ensure PQC DIDs work with existing Web3 infrastructure

### Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) Standards

**PQC Implementation**:
- **Privacy-Preserving Keys**: PQC keys that support privacy-preserving authentication
- **Verifiable Credentials**: PQC signatures for quantum-safe verifiable credentials
- **Identity Hubs**: PQC encryption for decentralized identity data storage

## Implementation Status

- âœ… Web3 and DID architecture design with PQC support
- âœ… Privacy-preserving PQC key management framework
- ðŸ”„ Full DID implementation with PQC (WBS 3.x-4.x - Future phases)
