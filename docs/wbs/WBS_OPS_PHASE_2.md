\# WBS\_OPS\_PHASE\_2 – Operational Maturity \& Trust Pipeline Observability



\*\*Artifact ID:\*\* WBS\_OPS\_PHASE\_2  

\*\*Date:\*\* July 3, 2025  

\*\*Maintainer:\*\* Ronak (CTO)  

\*\*Status:\*\* In Progress  

\*\*Scope:\*\* Device Trust (WBS 1.15), CI/CD, Logging, Monitoring  

\*\*Tags:\*\* ops, reliability, observability, compliance, incident-readiness



---



\## 🎯 Objectives



\- Define a runbook and operational readiness framework for trust pipeline

\- Establish standards for logging, metrics, and alerting

\- Introduce escalation protocols for fallback events and device-related incidents

\- Provide traceability guarantees for compliance and auditing

\- Codify ops guarantees post-WBS 1.15 launch

\## 🔁 Runtime Playbooks



| Flow | Trigger | Response |

|------|---------|----------|

| \*\*Device Verification Failure\*\* | Fingerprint mismatch, token missing, PQC cert rejected | Trace logged, user sent verification challenge |

| \*\*Fallback Triggered\*\* | ML-KEM failure or PQC cert invalid | CryptoFallbackTelemetry emitted, alert if 3+ in 60m |

| \*\*Replay Attempt\*\* | Reuse of expired or invalid cert | Reject and notify user, log to SIEM queue |

| \*\*Trust Drift Detection\*\* | Fingerprint deviation threshold breached | Soft challenge on next login, flagged for review |

| \*\*CI Pipeline Failure\*\* | One or more tests fail | Slack alert to `#trust-ops`, block PR merge |

| \*\*Doc Missing in PR\*\* | Missing DEVICE\_TRUST.md or SECURITY.md update | Lint fail + PR comment + block merge |

\## 🔒 Escalation Matrix



| Severity | Example Scenarios | Action | Owner |

|----------|-------------------|--------|-------|

| P0 | Replay exploit, trusted cert bypass | Immediate triage + hotfix + audit lock | Ronak (CTO) |

| P1 | Systemic fallback abuse | Notify engineering \& compliance | Infra Lead |

| P2 | Misconfigured trust flags | Schedule fix sprint | QA/Eng |

\## 📈 Observability



\### Logging Standards



\- All trust flow steps emit structured logs with:

&nbsp; - `user\_id`, `device\_id`, `flow\_step`, `fingerprint`, `trust\_result`, `timestamp`

\- Fallback triggers emit:

&nbsp; - `trace: CRYPTO\_FALLBACK\_USED`

&nbsp; - With: algorithm, reason, flow origin



\### Metrics (via Prometheus/OTel)



| Metric Name | Description |

|-------------|-------------|

| `trusted\_device\_validation\_success\_total` | Successful trust validations |

| `crypto\_fallback\_triggered\_total` | Total PQC fallbacks |

| `device\_registration\_pending\_total` | Devices pending post-login trust |

| `replay\_attempts\_detected\_total` | Reused certs flagged |

| `trust\_drift\_soft\_flags\_total` | Fingerprint deviation triggers |



\### Alerts



| Name | Condition | Action |

|------|-----------|--------|

| Fallback Spike | `>3 fallbacks / 60m` | Notify #trust-ops |

| Replay Risk | `>1 replay / 24h` | Security review |

| Drift Anomaly | `>5 drift flags / 24h` | UX team review |

| CI Failure | Pipeline red | PR block + Slack ping |



---



\## 🧪 Performance Targets



| Metric | Target |

|--------|--------|

| Trust validation latency | <100ms 99p |

| Device registration throughput | 100 rps sustained |

| Cert generation time | <300ms |

| Fallback tolerance | <1 per 5000 login events |



---



\## 🔄 CI/CD Hooks



\- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

&nbsp; - Verifies presence of:

&nbsp;   - `DEVICE\_TRUST.md`

&nbsp;   - `SECURITY.md`

&nbsp;   - `PR\_SECURITY\_CHECKLIST.md`

&nbsp; - Backend/frontend linting + tests

&nbsp; - Fail-fast enforcement



---



\## 🧾 Audit Readiness Guarantees



\- ✅ All trust events are traceable via structured logs

\- ✅ All fallback triggers are telemetry-wired and attributable

\- ✅ Documentation versioned and referenced in WBS freezes

\- ✅ All CI runs logged under PR history with SHA matching



---



\## 📘 Next Steps



\- \[ ] Integrate `cryptoFallbackTelemetry.ts` into Sentry

\- \[ ] Wire Prometheus OTel exporter for trust metrics

\- \[ ] Write `incident-response.md` for device trust pipeline

\- \[ ] Review logs with auditor for SOX/FedRAMP visibility
