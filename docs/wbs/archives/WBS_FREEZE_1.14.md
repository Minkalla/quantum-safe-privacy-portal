## ✅ Feature Summary

- 🔐 Implemented PQC fallback path via `HybridCryptoService`
- 💥 Circuit breaker with telemetry and crypto tracing
- 📈 Structured logs: fallback reasons, algorithm used, user ID, flow
- 🆔 Standardized `CryptoUserId` for deterministic hashing
- 📚 Updated: `SECURITY.md`, `paperwork.md`, `PR_SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`
- 📁 Docs restructured into `/docs/security/`, `/docs/dev-guides/`

## 🔎 Validation Artifacts

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| HybridCryptoService | ✅ | Fallback tested, deterministic crypto enforcement |
| Telemetry Logging | ✅ | Emits `CRYPTO_FALLBACK_USED` trace w/ full metadata |
| Circuit Breaker | ✅ | Functional under ML-KEM failure |  
| Test Coverage | ✅ | Manually verified with `simulateFailure = true` |
| Documentation | ✅ | Clean, modular, refactored |
| CI Pipeline | ⚠️ | Manual-only until GH Actions fully wired |

## 🧾 Compliance Mapping

- FedRAMP AC-17: Remote access control (SSO)
- NIST SP 800-53 IA-2(8): PKI-based auth fallback traceability
- OWASP ASVS 2.1.1, 2.1.4: Crypto agility, fallback observability
- Internal Audit Reference: `green-status-v1`

---

## 🧊 Freeze Guarantee

- All changes verified and merged to `main`
- Post-merge validation complete (Ronak)
- Tagged as WBS_1.14_FREEZE — Immutable unless compliance audit override granted

**Next Task:**  
🚀 Execute WBS 1.15 (Device Trust Management) – authorized and in-flight  
📘 See [`docs/DEVICE_TRUST.md`](../DEVICE_TRUST.md) for architecture  
📁 CI guardrails now enforced across `portal-frontend` and `portal-backend`
