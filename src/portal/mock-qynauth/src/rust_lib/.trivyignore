# Trivy ignore file for PQC-specific security scanning
# Based on Security-First Approach from NEW_ENGINEER_ONBOARDING_MESSAGE.md

# Ignore low-severity vulnerabilities in development dependencies
# Only CRITICAL and HIGH vulnerabilities will block deployment

# Development-only dependencies (not in production)
CVE-2023-XXXXX # Example: Development tool vulnerability

# Known false positives for PQC libraries
# (Add specific CVEs here if needed after security review)

# Note: This file should be minimal - most vulnerabilities should be fixed
# rather than ignored. Only add entries after security team approval.
